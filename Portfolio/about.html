    <img src = images/ChicagoPortrait.jpg alt = "A portrait of Natalie">

    <p> My name is Natalie Cieslak and I am a student at the University of Michigan â€“ Ann Arbor. I am studying user experience design through the School of Information and will graduate in May 2020. </p>

    <p> This past summer, I interned with the University of Michigan ITS Department in Human Resources. Through this experience, I had the opportunity to take part in numerous unique projects and work with many diverse teams. Before this internship I worked in the customer service industry. In the future, I hope to work in the tech industry doing some sort of UX design/research, web development, or technical consulting. I am also considering going to graduate school to earn an MBA. </p>

    <p> Some of the main things I am involved in on campus are Atlas Consulting Group in which I am the VP of Finance, the Gamma Phi Beta Sorority in which I am the Personal and Chapter Enrichment Chairwoman, and the Sport Business Association. </p>

    <p> My other interests include sports, traveling, and trying out new restaurants with friends and family. </p>
